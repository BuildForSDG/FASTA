## PROBLEM
HELP UPGRADING TRANSPORT AND LOGISTICS NETWORKS IN COMMUNITIES:
## BRIEF INTRODUCTION
 Strictly speaking, transport refers to the movementof people, and logistics refers to the movement of freight. It’s all about moving things, storing things and supplying things. And when we say ‘things’, we mean anything and everything, from people and animals to goods and services. Without the transport and logistics industry, we wouldn’t be able to get to work in the morning, or fly away on holiday, and international trade would certainly not be ‘inter-national’ anymore. Plus, you would never wake up to find a birthday card being stuffed through your letterbox.From the above definitions, FASTA is set in place to help upgrading transport and logistics networks in communities.

## HOW IS THIS PROJECT RELEVANT (How much lives can be improved with FASTA)
FASTA APP will enhance the well-being by saving of lives through our alternate transport solution.
1.  The global status Report on road safety 2018, lauched by WHO in December 2018, highlights that the number of annual road traffic deaths has reach 1.35 million. Road trafficinjuries are now the leading killer of people aged 5-29 years which makes it to be the eighth-leading cause of death. Don’t panic because FASTA is here to solve this problem.FASTA gives you access to avoid traffic congestion by alerting you and suggesting the shortest route to your destination.
2.  The level of insecurity to visitors, or a vulnerable individual who is new to an environment is at high site because that individual have no idea on how things are being done in the new environment. And this has buildup fear (to many travelling to a new place) of robbery, doping, kidnapping,paying twice or triple price of transportation and even being lost.FASTA has solved this challenge of insecurity to visitors by equipping them with all necessary information they will needeven before taking off. Hence improving the wellbeing.
3.  It was observed that people with vulnerability tend not to travel due to their challenge like acquiring of wheelchair, inhaler, having no access to specialist, and other medicate kit that will help them. Fasta tells you where to get a specialist and also where to acquire your medical kits.Time is money, thus, why wasting your time in a traffic congestion when you have customers to attend to, meetings,interview or exams, a lot of work on your desk to submit, emergency cases to attend to and more. I know it’s inevitable but with FASTA it’s now evitable. FASTA gives you update on road activities and also suggest the shortest routeto destination in a short time. No late to meeting, interview e.t.c caused due to traffic.
4.  It was observed that many having a critical challenges like heart attack, high blood pressure patients, and even victims of accident loss their lives before reaching the hospital or even before living their houses which is caused either through, delay of emergency van, having no contact of any hospital emergency unit and sometimes difficulty in getting a public vehicle at night. Fasta have solution to this problem whereby it give individualaccess to nearest hospital and also contact list of every emergency unit. FASTA is also giving individual access to contact public vehicle close to them (at that moment) at the same time suggesting a shortest route to the targeted hospital by cutting traffic congestion.

First, you can send a mail to [buildforsdg@andela.com](buildforsdg@andela.com) to indicate your interest, why you'd like to support and what forms of support you can bring to the table, but here are areas we think we'd need the most help in this project :
1.  area one (e.g this app is about human trafficking and you need feedback on your roadmap and feature list from the private sector / NGOs)
2.  area two (e.g you want people to opt-in and try using your staging app at staging.project-name.com and report any bugs via a form)
3.  area three (e.g here is the zoom link to our end-of sprint webinar, join and provide feedback as a stakeholder if you can)
